**Some points that I emphasized on while creating this map**

**1. Grid:** I like to add graticule to my map while making the latitude and longitude lines a bit transparent so that it doesn't take away attention from the main thing of my map. Also, I set the number of latitude and longitude lines according to my preference which I usually do after I set the map scale. According to the number of the lat and long lines, I adjust the number of ticks, interior ticks, and labels that I want to put on my map. I keep the number of interior ticks to a minimum to give it a really clean look. I also adjusted the length of the tick to make it more visible compared to the interior ones. Depending on the size of my map layout, the number of ticks on the horizontal and vertical axes are kept different.

**2. Color:** The part of the map that needs attention is given the most eye-catching color. In my case, it was green. As for the background, I would prefer something dark or grey, not too focused. Also, I try to keep the number of colors used in the main component of my map layout to a minimum (usually 3; Varieties of colors are used in the legend as needed).

**3. Scale  & Legend:** Also, I try to make sure the legend and scale don't grab too much attention by keeping them small and less prominent in terms of their color.

**4. Second Layout:** I try to add a second layout within my map to indicate the position of my study area on a bigger scale (country/province).
